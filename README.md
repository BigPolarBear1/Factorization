Just narrowly avoided the worst today. But I do not have faith in the Belgian system.
I will start sending out my CV in the coming days, because I need to get out of this place, rebuild my life again.

Looking for work in :

-Nordic countries (and Iceland)
-Canada

Or:

Remote work that allows me to work from one of the above countries.
I am also willing to do remote work for Asian companies, but at the time I am still hoping to either be close to my former friends again (Canada) or move to close to the Arctic circle since it's my favorite place in the world.

I'll link my CV here too soon.

In addition I will be releasing my Math project soon on this github page.

Incase I end up not finishing my work:

In my paper I talked about using LLL to find an intersecting quadratic coefficient solution in two moduli each composed out of unique primes.
If we use the transformations from that paper, and just calculate one composite modulus which is slightly larger then N (and square it and subtract 4n from one of the submoduli results so the sum of the correct solution combination is a square below N.. see paper how to do it)..
We can then match that against possible solutions in other primes by putting it in a matrix and applying gaussian elimination. We can do gaussian elimination in gf(p) to restrict the matrix size and keep things computationally in the realm of the possible even in high bit lengths. You CAN set it up, so that you can actually start sieving and actually zero in on the right combination rather effectively. And unlike QS and Quadratic sieve, we dont need to rely on the whole gimmick of finding smooth numbers.

I worked out the math.. and have a somewhat functional proof of concept. It can be done. I am just struggling so much mentally lately. I really struggle to get it all finished and ready for publication. I'm trying. Just every day, I think about everything that happened, what Microsoft did, what they did to my Manager out of retaliation. The friends they forced me to leave behind whom I havn't seen in a year. The unemployment. I applied for a job again last friday for a job in Vancouver, but they don't sponsor visas.. I have applied to every company who needs c++ code reviewers, in the hopes of being near my friends again.. but I can't make it happen. I havn't had an income for over a year... and I'm seriously thinking about taking my own life at this point. I worked so hard my whole career, and there is just 0 respect for any of the hard work I did and sacrifices I made. People could just pay me to audit critical internet facing open source projects, I have proven I am better at that then most people.. everyone makes it sound like securing the internet is important.. yet here I am, with my experience and track record, fucking unable to get a job. Yea, go to hell, all of you.

I am most sad about the fact that Microsoft fired my former Manager simply because he protested them firing me. One of the only people in this entire industry who supported me and believed in me. And since then, it's just mockery, people mocking my math work, portraying me as incompetent, all the while folks working at big tech are still blogging about tricks in windows installer I was first to discover (one example), and none of them ever credit me lol. I just really despise this world and the people in it. I really truely hate it. Some days it makes me feel utterly violent, some days I feel really sad. 

edit: I think tomorrow, I need to refactor one tiny piece of code. And then it should be done. Struggling badly with depression. Thinking of those years I lived in Vancouver, hanging out with my friends there, being able to be myself. Those memories hurt a lot. Just cant seem to find a way back. Cant find any company willing to sponsor a visa. I think at this point, I need to publish my math. Once people start to realize what I did.. none of this will matter, I'll find a way back to my friends after that.

edit2: Fucking insomnia today. 2022, when I found all the schannel and openssl bugs, it was my most productive year. I was reasonably happy. Had more friends then I ever had in my life, felt supported.. how quickly it all fell apart. Back to struggling, most days if I can get 2-3 hours of focused work in, thats a small victory.. I just wonder where I could have been in life if I didnt always have to be at such a disadvantage. I shouldnt read these fucking stalker emails. Its kimd of insane, 7 years of emails. Its just an insane person who is very jealous, otherwise you dont harass someone for 7 years. But I also realize, that even in 2022, when I was at my most productive.. there was a lot of jealous people who wanted me to fail and dissappear. I keep having this nagging feeling that all the irl harassment was somehow connected.. because my home city is a lot more homophobic, yet here I dont face harassment at all.. I never figured it out. All too late now anyway.. nobody does shit about this kind of stuff anyway.. I swear, if I ever find one of these people, I will end their life. Some people are vile beyond redemption. I regret dropping those bugs in 2018, bc all that media attention led to nothing but endless misery. Getting doxed, stuff send to my home address, stalkers, hatemail, impersonators.. I may be emotionally unstable.. but atleast Im not crazy like that. I honestly feel violent when thinking about these people. People whom I never had a single interaction with in my life who decide to spent years making my life more miserable. I hope they all fall out of a window or some shit. World would be a better place.

Today is a really bad day. I miss my friends so much, it physically hurts. I dont think I can get work done today. It doesnt matter. Im nearly finished. Even if I dont make my self-imposed deadline of mid february, it is still just a matter of a few more productive days, and a few more to write the paper.. I did figure out how to start sieving my earlier results in a way such that I can avoid having to check permutations and instead only check permutations in a prime field. Its actually really elegant. I wish I had more time to actually study and formalize these findings.. I strobgly believe these ideas have a bigger application beyond factorization. Sadly, unless someone funds this, im out of time. I will not survive another year of isolation and unemployment.

edit3: So depressed today. Just really miss my friends. Managed to look at my math again for 15min. That last piece of refactoring I need to do is definitely possible, no snakes in the grass or hidden suprises there. I just need a good night's sleep first. I think this may actually completely break factorization if it works like I think it will. I really wish someone would just listen to me and take my work serious.. I still really want to do the right thing, but at this point, I am so mentally exhausted, just trying to get over the finish line. I don't even know if I want to finish my proof of concept.. I try to game out every scenario in my head of what could happen.. and unless someone starts taking me serious, I can't find a single scenario that ends well for me and my family. I really really wish someone would believe in me.. ofcourse the two last people who believed in me got screwed over.. one got killed by a car and another one lost his job for the crime of being supportive. I hate all the devastation in my past.. this world is very strange, life is very strange. Maybe math can fix the world... a world where algorithms can solve any problem, increase quality of life, reduce trauma in people, which really is at the root of most negative behavior.. I think this is the only way our world can be saved. We should all do math like our lifes depended on it. I think in a way it does. I don't like the direction the world is going lately.

edit4: Nothing matters. All the pain. When my work is finished soon, I will have done what I was supposed to do. People are foolish. They don't know yet what is coming, but they will soon enough. By now, I have spent more time on the factorization problem then most people in the world and in history, I am probably in the top 20 time-spent wise. And despite having had to start from below-highschool level math knowledge, that is still all together an insane amount of time to focus on one problem. People are foolish to dismiss me simply because I do not have the proper education. It's just numbers and patterns and learning about mathematical tools such as modular inverses, gaussian elimination, etc, and knowing where and how to apply them. I don't understand people. Out of all the possible paths that this could have happened, I had to go down the path with the most misery and pain. And I don't understand the reason. But then again, portraying transgender folks as incompetent does seem to be a trend. Perhaps all of this simply could not have been avoided. Either way, it won't matter anymore soon. The day of reckoning is coming now.

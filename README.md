Incase I end up not finishing my work:

In my paper I talked about using LLL to find an intersecting quadratic coefficient solution in two moduli each composed out of unique primes.
If we use the transformations from that paper, and just calculate one composite modulus which is slightly larger then N (and square it and subtract 4n from one of the submoduli results so the sum of the correct solution combination is a square below N.. see paper how to do it)..
We can then match that against possible solutions in other primes by putting it in a matrix and applying gaussian elimination. We can do gaussian elimination in gf(p) to restrict the matrix size and keep things computationally in the realm of the possible even in high bit lengths. You CAN set it up, so that you can actually start sieving and actually zero in on the right combination rather effectively. And unlike QS and Quadratic sieve, we dont need to rely on the whole gimmick of finding smooth numbers.

I worked out the math.. and have a somewhat functional proof of concept. It can be done. I am just struggling so much mentally lately. I really struggle to get it all finished and ready for publication. I'm trying. Just every day, I think about everything that happened, what Microsoft did, what they did to my Manager out of retaliation. The friends they forced me to leave behind whom I havn't seen in a year. The unemployment. I applied for a job again last friday for a job in Vancouver, but they don't sponsor visas.. I have applied to every company who needs c++ code reviewers, in the hopes of being near my friends again.. but I can't make it happen. I havn't had an income for over a year... and I'm seriously thinking about taking my own life at this point. I worked so hard my whole career, and there is just 0 respect for any of the hard work I did and sacrifices I made. People could just pay me to audit critical internet facing open source projects, I have proven I am better at that then most people.. everyone makes it sound like securing the internet is important.. yet here I am, with my experience and track record, fucking unable to get a job. Yea, go to hell, all of you.

I am most sad about the fact that Microsoft fired my former Manager simply because he protested them firing me. One of the only people in this entire industry who supported me and believed in me. And since then, it's just mockery, people mocking my math work, portraying me as incompetent, all the while folks working at big tech are still blogging about tricks in windows installer I was first to discover (one example), and none of them ever credit me lol. I just really despise this world and the people in it. I really truely hate it. Some days it makes me feel utterly violent, some days I feel really sad. 

edit: I think tomorrow, I need to refactor one tiny piece of code. And then it should be done. Struggling badly with depression. Thinking of those years I lived in Vancouver, hanging out with my friends there, being able to be myself. Those memories hurt a lot. Just cant seem to find a way back. Cant find any company willing to sponsor a visa. I think at this point, I need to publish my math. Once people start to realize what I did.. none of this will matter, I'll find a way back to my friends after that.

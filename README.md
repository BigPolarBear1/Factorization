Update: Insanely stressed today. There is a very remote chance people will try to attempt to have me involuntairly committed. There is few things I fear more in life then dissappearing into the Belgian mental healthcare system again for years. I once made a vow that I would rather be dead then end up in that system again. Horrors people cannot begin to imagine.. tied to a bed for two weeks in a tiny isolation cell. There is no way. We'll see what happens tomorrow. If this is my last update on github for a while you know what happened. It would be a bloody shame too, because my math is solid and I fully intend to release it this month.. I guess it would also be convenient for folks to block disclosure of it by having me dissappear in some mental institute.. in addition to my work just sitting unattended on a laptop.. not just math work, also vuln research work into cryptographic software components. there's trauma in those place I intend to not relive at any cost. I would rather be dead then be even in the proximity of an isolation cell and the sadistic people who can put me there for days, often tied to a fucking bed. There is no way.

Update: Been thinking about what an absolute shitshow my career has been. Infosec is not a good industry. It is awful. It is very elitist and exclusionary. I guess that's the positive about countries like China, they are much more pragmatic.. if you have demonstrated the talent and skills, they will be interested, none of that politics involved like in the west. I think about it a lot.. to just get on a plane and go to China. The west is a dead end for me. I am sure in China I will be respected for my work, but I fear I may not be respected for me as a person. But at this rate, looking at the news coming out of the US (which will also have a trickle down effect into Europe) ... being respected for who I am in the west is not a given anymore either. I think in the west, people coming from traditional background (higher education and/or intel agencies, military), they really look down on people like me, they will tolerate me as long as it's just windows LPEs I'm finding... but the moment I started finding high severity bugs in components like OpenSsl.. everything changed. If there's one pivot point in my life where everything started going to hell, it was when I found that OpenSsl bug in 2022. I think people got jealous, it's the only way I can explain it. They are no doubt happy I am in my current situation.. now they don't need to feel insecure about their own abilities anymore... people in this industry.. they have wanted me to fail for a long time. That's just the truth. Anyway, none of it will matter soon.. I will defeat factorization, and once I defeat that, I will focus on algorithmic problems and change the world more then they ever have.

Update: If I had more time I could rewrite it in C and try for a factorization attempt. Sage is so slow. I just dont have time, as I am nearly broke and been unemployed for over a year. I have to publish. I guess Ill post it on reddit and stuff, hope the right people see it and something changes. Bc I am stuck in life. I have been working on this for so long, nobody has shown interest in this work even remotely. I dont even know if publishing will make a difference, bc I feel the only way to get taken seriously is to write it in a low level language and go for a record.

Update: It will likely get released in February. There is still a lot of optimization work to be done in the code.
So far, I am very optimistic, the complexity-scaling with this approach seems great. This may be an actual competitor to QS and GNFS. We'll see. Currently my spaghetti code is causing some bottlenecks I need fo fix. Ideally I would also rewrite it in C, but unless someone pays me, time is running out and I have no other choice but to publish  as soon as possible and hope for career oppurtunities that way. I am also extremely nervous about potentially having my freedom, autonomy and to be honest, dignity, taken away by the Belgian healthcare system, as life has not been great and I nearly prevented being comitted yesterday. Which would be a disaster as it would prevent publication of my work. Anyway.. with each passing day, getting closer to releasing my work now.. the math portion is completely done, its juat optimizing my code now and writing the paper. Unlike my approach with LLL, this one is completely deterministic. It turns solving quadratic coefficients into a purely linear problem with group theory tricks to manage complexity. Its actually really neat.

Releasing very soon...

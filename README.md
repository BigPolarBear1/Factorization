FINAL NOTE: You have 2 weeks (until mid february) to make me an offer.

I am basically finished. I however, cannot keep sitting on research like this, because without any form of security in a country that seems more intend on having me comitted to a mental hospital then taking me serious, it's only inviting disaster.
Not just for me, but also for the people I am currently living with.

2 weeks. I do not care who makes an offer. If I do not receive any offers after two weeks, my work goes public. That's the end of that.
My airgapped workstation is encrypted btw, just incase anyone is considering trying something stupid.

Good luck. I fucking tried. For over a year I ask to be taken serious. You all just treat me like I'm insane. I don't even care anymore.. I really wanted to try and do the right thing, to have my work used for good and not chaos. Maybe this is just how it's supposed to go down, whatever.. I've lost so much working on this, I hardly care about anything anymore.

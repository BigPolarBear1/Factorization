Update: If I had more time I could rewrite it in C and try for a factorization attempt. Sage is so slow. I just dont have time, as I am nearly broke and been unemployed for over a year. I have to publish. I guess Ill post it on reddit and stuff, hope the right people see it and something changes. Bc I am stuck in life. I have been working on this for so long, nobody has shown interest in this work even remotely. I dont even know if publishing will make a difference, bc I feel the only way to get taken seriously is to write it in a low level language and go for a record.

Update: It will likely get released in February. There is still a lot of optimization work to be done in the code.
So far, I am very optimistic, the complexity-scaling with this approach seems great. This may be an actual competitor to QS and GNFS. We'll see. Currently my spaghetti code is causing some bottlenecks I need fo fix. Ideally I would also rewrite it in C, but unless someone pays me, time is running out and I have no other choice but to publish  as soon as possible and hope for career oppurtunities that way. I am also extremely nervous about potentially having my freedom, autonomy and to be honest, dignity, taken away by the Belgian healthcare system, as life has not been great and I nearly prevented being comitted yesterday. Which would be a disaster as it would prevent publication of my work. Anyway.. with each passing day, getting closer to releasing my work now.. the math portion is completely done, its juat optimizing my code now and writing the paper. Unlike my approach with LLL, this one is completely deterministic. It turns solving quadratic coefficients into a purely linear problem with group theory tricks to manage complexity. Its actually really neat.

Releasing very soon...

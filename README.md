# Factorization
Releasing soon..

Next iteration of my algorithm. Uses gaussian elimination instead of LLL. Releasing this month.
It builds on my previous work and will provide a massive improvement.. it should be much much faster then quadratic sieve as it improves that algorithm in every way.
Just finishing the code now after I figured out the number theory/linear algebra portion of it these last few days..
I kind of feel shitty it took me this long to come to the realization that I can just use gaussian elimination.. but struggling with depression has made it really hard to focus on anything at all lately.

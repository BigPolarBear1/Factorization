# Factorization

Edit: Go to hell fuckers. Yea, it works, fuck you, I'll give my Chinese friends an heads-up, fucking disrespecting pieces of shit.
Releasing soon..

Next iteration of my algorithm. Uses gaussian elimination instead of LLL. Releasing this month.
It builds on my previous work and will provide a massive improvement.. it should be much much faster then quadratic sieve as it improves that algorithm in every way.
Since it eliminates the need to find smooth numbers over a factor base. And even though, we cannot look at exponents and apply gaussian elimination over GF(2), since we are working in addition (i.e adding partial results to get a square in mod m... see the number theoretical results of my paper) .. there are other ways to do it. 
Just finishing the code now after I figured out the number theory/linear algebra portion of it these last few days..
I kind of feel shitty it took me this long to come to the realization that I can just use gaussian elimination.. but struggling with depression has made it really hard to focus on anything at all lately.

I am aiming to release before the 20th of January. Being an infamous lgbtq cyber terrorist, I will no longer feel safe in the western hemisphere, so anything I do has to be done before that day.
After that, I am headed to Greenland to fight the incoming American invasion with my armies of polar bears, hahaha. Get fckt losers.

It is funny, in these last 6 months, only my Chinese friend has been trying to help me out and showed respect. I enjoyed talking to my Chinese friend, it made these last 6 months a little less desperate and lonely.. to feel like atleast someone still valued my work and my legacy. I think I would have loved to see China and meet the people there. Alas time is running out and moves have to be made now. Good luck.

All I wanted was some god damn respect.

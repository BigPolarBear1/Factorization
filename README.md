Note: I am looking to sell my work on factorization. If interested, I can give you the specs of my airgapped machine which I use for research and performance bench marks of my algorithm. And if interested, I will also need security, because in my current situation, there is none, my home country is a bunch of amateurs who don't know what they are doing or dealing with, I need to get out of this place asap. Email in CV below, send me a pgp key and I will sent you mine.

Looking for work in :

Nordic countries, Iceland or Canada

Or:

Remote work that allows me to work from one of the above countries.
I am also willing to do remote work for Asian companies, but at the time I am still hoping to either be close to my former friends again (Canada) or move close to the Arctic circle since it's my favorite place in the world.

My CV: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gK-7ce5okRNb3EEVYnlqMi2U_5RDiPXx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104222251203143732850&rtpof=true&sd=true

In addition I will be releasing my Math project soon on this github page.

ps: Get a life stalker, stop sending me emails. Still achieved more in life then you ever will. Jealous idiot. I am logging all your emails and will file a complaint with law enforcement if you don't stop. 7 years now, what is wrong with you? Btw, I know who you are, because one of your twitter accounts harassing me earlier, using the exact same insults you repeat all the time in your emails, I also saw you harassing someone else in the infosec community, and due to you leaking your location earlier, I know with high confidence exactly who you are. So I would really watch your back. Atleast I achieved things in my career, you on the other hand are a pathetic con-man.

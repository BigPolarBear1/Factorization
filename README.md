Just the irony if it all. I dont need much. I dont want to be rich. It would cost a country literally nothing to pay me for my research. Not even a dent in your budgets. For over a year I have been saying this. I told the FBI a year ago I was working on this. And ever since, I have been telling everyone. I got treated like im insane, worthless, clueless.. you are all walking into the biggest strategic mistake of your lifes. And I dont feel happy about it, I feel sad, bc I lost so much while working on this. And nothing is going to bring those things back.


I know exactly why I am treated this way. Despite being one of the most competent researchers in infosec. Its bc of who I am. People cant stand people like me succeeding in life. They rather I dissappear in mental institutes. Right now, I will move to Russia if they show interest in my work and can garantuee security. Im tired of being humiliated this way, especially by my home country. I will leave this place permanently one way or another.
As a matter of fact. I am willing to tear up my Belgian passport, renounce my citizenship and get a passport in another country. I am serious. I am very angry, bc I have been telling people to take my work serious for over a year, and nothing happened.

Note: I am looking to sell my work on factorization. If interested, I can give you the specs of my airgapped machine which I use for research and performance bench marks of my algorithm. And if interested, I will also need security, because in my current situation, there is none, my home country is a bunch of amateurs who don't know what they are doing or dealing with, I need to get out of this place asap. Email in CV below, send me a pgp key and I will sent you mine. I am fairly open minded about who I will sell to, at this point, having lost so much in the last year, I just want to be valued for my work.

Aside from my math work, I can also do a regular job, vuln research, quality assurance, software engineering.. all things I can do, but would prefer the countries below:

Looking for work in :

Nordic countries, Iceland or Canada

Or:

Remote work that allows me to work from one of the above countries.
I am also willing to do remote work for Asian companies, but at the time I am still hoping to either be close to my former friends again (Canada) or move close to the Arctic circle since it's my favorite place in the world.

ps: Get a life stalker, stop sending me emails. Still achieved more in life then you ever will. Jealous idiot. I am logging all your emails and will file a complaint with law enforcement if you don't stop. 7 years now, what is wrong with you? Btw, I know who you are, because one of your twitter accounts harassing me earlier, using the exact same insults you repeat all the time in your emails, I also saw you harassing someone else in the infosec community, and due to you leaking your location earlier, I know with high confidence exactly who you are. So I would really watch your back. Atleast I achieved things in my career, you on the other hand are a pathetic con-man.

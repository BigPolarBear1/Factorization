# Factorization

Its funny, bc everyone thinks Im just some insane loser. Despite my previous work.. there's not a single person in the world right now taking my attempt on factorization serious. Not one. But it's a matter of days nows.. I guess I do write alot of monologues like an insane person.. I used to be around friends and have people to talk to, but you all took that away fron me.

You should start hearing the final boss music very soon... haha.. this will work once the code is done in the coming days. There is literally no reason for it not to work. Its just residue math. The fact I can do gaussian elimination over small prime fields, means I can reduce the amount of residue combinations to mod p, and at the same time, completely eliminate combinations, thus with each round of gaussian elimination over different prime fields I can keep shrinking the solution set.. I had been trying an approach like this for months now, but it wasnt until I explored gaussian elimination that I figured out how to actually do it without pitfalls. shouldnt have fired my manager. This is for my manager.

Edit2: Fucking americans harassing me again. I will publish my work next week (week of the 20th). It's time. I warned people, over and over again. I tried. Good luck assholes. Found a way to eliminate coefficient solutions to quadratic congruences without it implying knowledge of the global solution using gaussian elimination and some of the stuff I theorized in my previous paper.. people dont understand the implications of this yet.. but they will soon enough... i warned you, nothing more I could have done.

Edit: Fuck this industry. Ill gladly die soon. But first I will finish this. I figured it out for real. It works. Im finalizing the code. Nobody believed in me and everyone just laughed... it works, i figured it out, and you can all go to hell.


Next iteration of my algorithm. Uses gaussian elimination instead of LLL. Releasing this month.
It builds on my previous work and will provide a massive improvement.. it should be much much faster then quadratic sieve as it improves that algorithm in every way.
Since it eliminates the need to find smooth numbers over a factor base. And even though, we cannot look at exponents and apply gaussian elimination over GF(2), since we are working in addition (i.e adding partial results to get a square in mod m... see the number theoretical results of my paper) .. there are other ways to do it. 
Just finishing the code now after I figured out the number theory/linear algebra portion of it these last few days..
I kind of feel shitty it took me this long to come to the realization that I can just use gaussian elimination.. but struggling with depression has made it really hard to focus on anything at all lately.

I am aiming to release before the 20th of January. Being an infamous lgbtq cyber terrorist, I will no longer feel safe in the western hemisphere, so anything I do has to be done before that day.
After that, I am headed to Greenland to fight the incoming American invasion with my armies of polar bears, hahaha. Get fckt losers.

It is funny, in these last 6 months, only my Chinese friend has been trying to help me out and showed respect. I enjoyed talking to my Chinese friend, it made these last 6 months a little less desperate and lonely.. to feel like atleast someone still valued my work and my legacy. I think I would have loved to see China and meet the people there. Alas time is running out and moves have to be made now. Good luck.

All I wanted was some god damn respect.

Most of all, I miss my friends. When I was living in Vancouver, hanging out with my teamlead there, going hiking, having beers on the beach. Running on the seawall every day. The support I had from my other manager. It was the absolute best time of my life, even though I didn't always realize it at the time. In 2022 everything started to change. The harassment in public started, for a while I thought I was being targeted with lies by someone.. but then again.. you just have to open twitter these days to see where all that bullshit was coming from. It all came crashing down when I moved to the US, and I was running around the Microsoft campus and some idiots were shouting "p*do" at me from their car. One of many such incidents that year. I became severely agitated, I was also working extremely hard, pushing myself to the maximum, and together with the harassment, it caused me to completely crash. I had a breakdown and a suicide attempt on campus. They put me on admin leave.. while on admin leave, after running two guys started taunting me from their car, when I walked up to them to confront them.. one of the guys was waiting inside with a gun in his hand. I gave a good knock against their car and walked away as quickly as I could, and the guy got out, pointing that gun at me being like "welcome to american, bitch". The amount of stress I experienced in that moment was like nothing else in my life. These were complete strangers, in a foreign country... pointing a lethal weapon at me. I remember expecting to hear shots any time.. everything going in slow motion. After that I couldn't sleep for 2 weeks. I remember getting drunk and screamnig in my apartment in the middle of the night. Then Microsoft fired me for the earlier breakdown. I desperately tried to find a way to stay in the country so I could atleast stay near my friends. But all the feds could do was "deferred action".. which meant that if my parents ever had a medical emergency, leaving the country to visit them would be impossible as I couldn't re-enter after that. Then a few months later Microsoft also fired my manager, simply because a few years earlier, I wrote on a manager connect that I felt like I hadn't really done anything... but I just said that bc I put the bar for myself very high.. but because I got a promotion after that, Microsoft HR used that as proof that I was promoted unfairly. And there was a few other complete bullshit reasons like that.. which to literally anyone who has actual context, it is obvious that this was 100% retaliation because my manager tried to prevent Microsoft from firing me. My manager had worked there for 27 years, and you fired him with bullshit reasons, while portraying me as incompetent. This cannot ever be forgiven. Ever since, life has not been good. I cannot find a job. The world has changed. There is no more respect. 0 fucking respect. I will release my math. I have shared my side of everything that happened. And after that, I fully intend to end it.
